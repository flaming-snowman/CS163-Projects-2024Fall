> In 3D semantic segmentation, our goal is to assign a class label to every point in a LiDAR point cloud. Compared to pixel grids of 2D images, point clouds are unordered and sparse, making them more challenging to work with. 3D semantic segmentation has many uses, most notably in autonomous driving. We will discuss PointNet, PointTransformerV3, and Panoptic-Polarnet.

2D semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to every pixel in an image. In 3D sematic segmentation, we assign a class label to every point in a LiDAR point cloud. This is a more challenging task due to the sparsity and unordered nature of point clouds, resulting in a lack of inherent spatial relationships between points and making it difficult to utilize traditional grid-based operations like convolutions.

Some researchers transform point clouds into voxel grids, a 3D counterpart to pixels. However, voxelization results in an extremely voluminious data representation, making it computationally prohibitive. Instead, we focus on techniques that directly leverage point clouds to perform 3D semantic segmentation.
